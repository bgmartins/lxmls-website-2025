Lisbon Machine Learning School (LxMLS) 2025 -- CALL FOR MONITORS
=================================================================

The Lisbon Machine Learning School (LxMLS) is a one-week summer school
taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, and focused on Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The school hosts around 200 students selected from
more than 500 applicants from around the world and enjoys top
lecturers in machine learning from academia and industry.

We are looking for candidates to take following responsibilities

- Master the LxMLS lab guide and code. See last year's guide as reference
  http://lxmls.it.pt/2024/documents/LxMLS_guide_2024.pdf

- Tutor students during the labs sessions explaining exercises and solving the
  student's doubts.

- Assist in the organization of the school including Q&As and organization of
  social activities

The ideal profile for this role is former LxMLS alumni around the
world that would like to repeat the experience but want to keep
learning ML and NLP. If you have extensive Python and ML experience
and feel like you could teach the guide, this can also be a good role
for you. We organize the team with Git/GitHub so experience with both
is a plus.

You will be able to attend morning and afternoon lectures for free. With the
exception of the lab sessions, monitors rotate in activities so that there is
available free time during the school.
